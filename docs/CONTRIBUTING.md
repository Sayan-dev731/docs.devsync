- üß™ **Testing**: Add or improve test coverage
- üîß **DevOps**: Improve development and deployment processes
- üåê **Translations**: Help make DevSync accessible globally

### Ways to Get Started

1. **Browse Issues**: Look for issues labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted`
2. **Report Bugs**: Found a bug? Create a detailed issue report
3. **Suggest Features**: Have an idea? Open a feature request
4. **Improve Documentation**: Help others understand the codebase
5. **Review Pull Requests**: Help review and test pending changes

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Fork and Clone

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub
# Then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/devsync.git
cd devsync

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-repo/devsync.git
```

### 2. Set Up Development Environment

Follow the [Setup Guide](SETUP_GUIDE.md) to configure your local development environment:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env

# Configure your .env file with development values
# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### 3. Create a Feature Branch

```bash
# Create and switch to a new branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# OR for bug fixes
git checkout -b fix/issue-description
```

## üìù Development Workflow

### 1. Coding Standards

#### JavaScript Style Guide

- Use **ES6+** features and modern JavaScript
- Follow **camelCase** for variables and functions
- Use **PascalCase** for classes and constructors
- Use **UPPER_SNAKE_CASE** for constants
- Prefer **const** over **let**, avoid **var**

**Example:**
```javascript
// Good
const API_BASE_URL = 'https://api.github.com';
const userController = new UserController();

async function getUserContributions(username) {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE_URL}/users/${username}`);
    return await response.json();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching user data:', error);
    throw error;
  }
}

// Avoid
var api_url = 'https://api.github.com';
function get_user_data(user) {
  // ...
}
```

#### CSS Guidelines

- Use **BEM methodology** for class naming
- Prefer **CSS Grid** and **Flexbox** for layouts
- Use **CSS custom properties** for theming
- Follow **mobile-first** responsive design

**Example:**
```css
/* Good */
.project-card {
  display: grid;
  gap: var(--space-4);
  padding: var(--space-4);
  border-radius: var(--border-radius);
}

.project-card__title {
  font-size: var(--text-lg);
  font-weight: var(--font-semibold);
}

.project-card__meta {
  color: var(--text-muted);
}

/* Responsive */
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .project-card {
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr;
  }
}
```

#### File Organization

```
New Feature Structure:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models/NewModel.js          # Database schema
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ routes/newRoutes.js         # API endpoints
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ controllers/newController.js # Business logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ middleware/newMiddleware.js  # Custom middleware
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/newUtils.js           # Utility functions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ public/new-page.html        # Frontend page
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ public/assets/css/new.css   # Styles
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ public/assets/js/new.js     # Frontend logic
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ templates/newEmail.html     # Email template
```

### 2. Commit Guidelines

#### Commit Message Format

Follow the **Conventional Commits** specification:

```
type(scope): subject

body

footer
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**
```bash
# Feature
git commit -m "feat(auth): add GitHub OAuth integration"

# Bug fix
git commit -m "fix(api): resolve user profile sync issue"

# Documentation
git commit -m "docs(readme): update installation instructions"

# Breaking change
git commit -m "feat(api): redesign user authentication flow

BREAKING CHANGE: The authentication API has been redesigned.
Existing integrations will need to be updated."
```

#### Commit Best Practices

- **Make atomic commits**: One logical change per commit
- **Write clear messages**: Explain what and why, not how
- **Reference issues**: Include issue numbers when applicable
- **Keep commits small**: Easier to review and revert if needed

### 3. Pull Request Process

#### Before Creating a PR

```bash
# Sync with upstream
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main

# Rebase your feature branch
git checkout feature/your-feature
git rebase main

# Run tests
npm test

# Check code quality
npm run lint
```

#### Creating a Pull Request

1. **Use the PR template** (automatically loaded)
2. **Write a clear title** following commit message format
3. **Describe changes** thoroughly in the description
4. **Link related issues** using keywords like "Fixes #123"
5. **Add screenshots** for UI changes
6. **Request reviews** from relevant maintainers

const User = require('../../models/User');

describe('User Model', () => {
  describe('Badge Assignment', () => {
    it('should assign First Contribution badge for 1 merged PR', async () => {
      const user = new User({
        githubId: '12345',
        username: 'testuser',
        email: 'test@example.com',
        mergedPRs: [{
          repoId: 'test/repo',
          prNumber: 1,
          title: 'Test PR',
          mergedAt: new Date()
        }]
      });

      await user.save();
      const badges = await assignBadges(user);
      
      expect(badges).toContain('First Contribution');
    });
  });
});
```

#### Integration Tests

```javascript
// tests/api/auth.test.js
const request = require('supertest');
const app = require('../../app');

describe('Authentication API', () => {
  it('should redirect to GitHub OAuth', async () => {
    const response = await request(app)
      .get('/auth/github')
      .expect(302);
    
    expect(response.headers.location).toContain('github.com');
  });
});
```

### Test Coverage Requirements

- **Minimum 80%** overall coverage
- **New features** must include comprehensive tests
- **Bug fixes** should include regression tests
- **Critical paths** require 95%+ coverage

## üìö Documentation Standards

 * @param {Array} mergedPRs - Array of merged pull requests
 * @param {string} userId - GitHub user ID
 * @returns {Promise<number>} Total points earned
 * @throws {Error} When calculation fails
 * 
 * @example
 * const points = await calculatePoints(user.mergedPRs, user.githubId);
 * console.log(`User earned ${points} points`);
 */
async function calculatePoints(mergedPRs, userId) {
  // Implementation...
}
```

#### API Documentation

```javascript
/**
 * @route GET /api/user/stats
 * @description Get user statistics and contribution data
 * @access Private (requires authentication)
 * @param {string} req.user.githubId - Authenticated user's GitHub ID
 * @returns {Object} User statistics including points, badges, and contributions
